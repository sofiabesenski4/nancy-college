#First layer

#Now to prepare the image data:

#reshaping the data to fit 60000 samples into image sizes of 28*28
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28*28))
#reforming the value stored in each pixel by normalizing it between 0-255 to define how dark the grey is

#same goes for 
test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28*28))
test_images = test_images.astype('float32')/255


#preparing the labels and categorizing them
train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels)
test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels)

#now to run the training(fit) function

#now to test how well our model learned!
