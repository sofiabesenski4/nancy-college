# README

This project is becoming less of a stock trader, and more like an OOP data science toolkit.

I intend to use it over the course of my honours project, making it easier to iterate on the 
data science experimental cycles.

## Rails front-end
Provide a UI to kick off background jobs using Faktory, which are processed by Flask microservices.

## Microservices
Provide an API which wraps python libraries such as numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, keras, pytorch to implement the standard ML workflow. While this ML tooling is still being developed (and my honours project hasnt technically started yet), I will spend time looking into other people's ML projects, and try to extract meaningful functionality into reusable parts.
Also this will give me a nice way to get exposed and actively research other people's projects.


The python microservices directory relies on pyenv and direnv
