# README

I intend to use this tool over the course of my honours project, making it easier to iterate on the 
data science experimental cycles, and compare different approaches to solve the same problem.

## Rails Front-End - Faktory - Python Workers
Provide a UI to kick off background jobs using Faktory, which are processed by a Faktory worker in Python3.

## 
Provide an API which wraps python libraries such as numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, keras, pytorch
to implement the standard ML workflow. While this ML tooling is still being developed (and my
honours project hasnt technically started yet), I will spend time looking into
other people's ML projects, and try to extract meaningful functionality into reusable parts.
Also this will give me a nice way to get exposed and actively research other people's projects.


The python microservices directory relies on pyenv and direnv
